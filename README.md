Scrape social media websites (currently just twitter) for peoples' conversations related to a specific cryptocurrency. The users tweets will be used to create an inverted index, which can be searched by the user. We also would like to implement a feature to generate sentences very similar in sentiment to that of the majority of the sentences. This will act as a sort of tl;dr (too long; didn't read) if the user does not want to go through the inverted index.



**Main Goals:**


Let users search tweets with the use of an inverted index and cryptocurrencies

Users can also find which key words are being used more often during discussions of various crypto coins.

Generate a summary or sentence with similar sentiment of a specific crypto coin

Show relationship between sentiment/ or specific words used and the current price of the chosen cryptocurrency.
