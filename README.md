# CryptoSent

**Shariar Kabir & Jordan Yaqoob** <br /><br />
**Project Description:** <br />


Scrape social media websites (currntly just twitter) for peoples conversation related to a specefic cryptocurrency. The users tweets will be used to create an inverted index, which can be then searchable by the user. We also would also like to implement a feature to generate sentences very similar in sentiment to that of the majority of the sentences. This will act as a sort of tl;dr if the user does not want to go through the inverted index.



**Main Goals:**


Let users search tweets with the use of an inverted index and cryptocurrencies

Generate a summary or sentence with similar sentiment of a specefic crypto coin

Show relationship between sentiment/ or specefic words used and the current price of the chosen cryptocurrency.
